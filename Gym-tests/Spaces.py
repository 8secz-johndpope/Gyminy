#Spaces

#Every environment comes with an action_space and an observation_space. These attributes are of type Space, and they describe the format of valid actions and observations:
#The Discrete space allows a fixed range of non-negative numbers, so in this case valid actions are either 0 or 1. The Box space represents an n-dimensional box, so valid observations will be an array of 4 numbers. We can also check the Boxâ€™s bounds:

import gym
env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')
print(env.action_space)
#> Discrete(2)
print(env.observation_space)
#> Box(4,)
